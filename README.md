I made a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier that categorizes movie reviews as positive or negative based off of the text in the review. I trained and tested my classifier on a corpus of movie reviews. Each movie review in the corpus has been labeled to be either postive (5-star) or negative (1-star).  Only 5-star and 1-star reviews are included in the corpus.
